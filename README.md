# Final-Project-
Pac-Man Game 

Our interpretation of the classic PacMan arcade game. The character can
move around the screen using the four arrow keys attempting to 'eat'
all of the tokens while avoiding the 'Ghosts.' When all tokens are
gone, the player wins and can choose to play again. However, if the 
player touches a ghost, then they lose a life. Once all lives are 
gone, the player loses the game, and can then chose to play again.
